tcproxy is a small efficient tcp proxy that can be used to 
port forwarding or load balance.

notice:
  if no ip address spacified, any is used. localhost is used as 127.0.0.1

sample usage:
  tcproxy "11212 -> 11211"
  tcproxy "192.168.0.1:11212 -> 192.168.0.2:11211"
  tcproxy "any:11212 -> rr{192.168.0.100:11211 192.168.0.101:11211 192.168.0.102:11211}"
  tcproxy "any:11212 -> hash{192.168.0.100:11211 192.168.0.101:11211 192.168.0.102:11211}"
