tcproxy is a high performance tcp proxy that can be used to 
port forwarding and load balance.

if no ip address spacified, 127.0.0.1 is used.

sample usage:
  tcproxy ":11212 -> :11211"
  tcproxy "192.168.0.1:11212 -> 192.168.0.2:11211"
  tcproxy "any:11212 -> rr{192.168.0.100:11211 192.168.0.101:11211 192.168.0.102:11211}"
  tcproxy "any:11212 -> hash{192.168.0.100:11211 192.168.0.101:11211 192.168.0.102:11211}"
